# UFO-Sighting-Shape-Predictor

Attempt at predicting reported UFO shapes in sightings based on:
  - Location
  - Summary Sentiment
  - Day reported
  - Month reported
  - Year reported

So, this didn't work, but I enjoyed working with this dataset. Flair was used for sentiment analysis.

#### Flair:
Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling (Akbik et al., COLING 2018) FLAIR: An Easy-to-Use Framework for State-of-the-Art NLP (Akbik et al., NAACL 2019)
